If you have .Net 7.0 you can run the application with dotnet run command.

The gray area is clickable, and the table moves to where the user clicks. The blue square represents the table, and the red squares represents the motors. Controls are located in the upper right corner.

When the checkboxes are checked, the table will move only along the specified axis upon clicking. For example, if only "Move on X" is checked, the table will only move along the X axis regardless of where the user clicks. The table's coordinates along the selected axes can also be moved using the buttons.

Additionally, the speed can be individually adjusted for each motor using the "+" and "-" buttons. The Z motor can only be moved manually by clicking the buttons, and its current position is displayed.
